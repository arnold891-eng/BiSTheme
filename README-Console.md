# The BiS header — `BiS> _` prompt (`BiSTheme/Console.lua`, CONSOLE_MINOR 4)

The title of every BiS window is a command prompt. It shows `BiS> ` in accent, then words
that rotate through what the addon is doing, then a cursor blinking at 2 Hz. Words fade out
and in — never a hard cut. Nothing the addon says about itself goes to chat any more; chat is
for `/slash` answers only.

    BiS> Summon_          →  BiS> 2 at stone_          →  BiS> Druid asks_

Arn, 8 Sep 2026: *"prompt `BiS> _` blinking should be in the header and cycle relevant
messages, addon name, summoners at the stone, receiving summon, requesting summon, etc."*
Innervate's rotating `▼2 online` title was the ancestor.

## Two kinds of text

| | what | how long | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **slot** | state that lasts | rotates every `cycle` (3 s) while it has text | `Summon` · `2 at stone` · `requesting...` · `preview - nothing sends` |
| **say** | an event | jumps the queue, holds `hold` (3 s), then slots resume; several queue up | `Druid asks` · `X accepted` · `request now` · `stone learned` |

Slot 1 is always the addon's name in `accent`. Clear a slot with `nil` the moment the state
ends. Colour by meaning, palette names only: `good` counts/yes, `gold` asks/"mine", `warn`
declines, `muted` going quiet, `ink2` plain.

## API

```lua
local con = BiSTheme.Console(titleFontString, { width = 106 })   -- opts: width, size, cycle, hold, fade
con:Set("name",  "Summon", "accent")        -- slot; nil or "" clears it
con:Set("stone", "2 at stone", "good")
con:Say("Druid asks", "gold")               -- event line
con:Paint()                                 -- from a ~0.2 s ticker: blink, rotate, fade, expire
con:Clear()                                 -- drops the QUEUE, not the line showing
con.line                                    -- { text, colour } on screen right now
con:Text()  con:Width()                     -- prompt + words + cursor, for asserts
BiSTheme.Fit(fs, text, width)               -- trim with "..." until GetStringWidth fits
BiSTheme.CONSOLE = { cycle = 3, hold = 3, fade = 0.25, size = 8, prompt = "BiS> " }
```

The console makes **one extra FontString** for the words, anchored `LEFT` of the title's
`RIGHT`, so the words fade on their own while `BiS> ` stands still. `Fit` trims the plain
words only, then wraps prompt, colour and cursor around what survived — it never cuts inside
a colour escape.

## Adopting it in a window — five steps

1. Copy `BiSTheme/Console.lua` → `<Addon>/Libs/BiSTheme/Console.lua` **byte-identical**
   (md5 `9af6af04…` today). First TOC line. `_bisdev/sync.ps1` keeps it in step; never edit
   the copy — change canon, sync out.
2. Header layout: `4 + prompt … | buttons at −3 / −17 / −38` (12×12 boxes). No logo, no pin.
   Prompt width = `W − strip − 8`. **Write the arithmetic as a comment where the number is
   set** — `486 − 316 = 158 clear, held 148` is checkable a year later; `width = 148` is not.
3. Code:
   ```lua
   local title = K.fs(head, "", 8, "ink")  title:SetPoint("LEFT", head, "LEFT", 4, 0)
   NS.con = BiSTheme.Console(title, { width = W - 56 - 8 })
   NS.con:Set("name", "Nebbinator", "accent")
   -- state → con:Set(key, text|nil, colour)   events → con:Say(text, colour)
   -- ticker 0.1–0.2 s while shown → NS.con:Paint()
   ```
   Route every window-side print through `Say`; keep `NS.Print` for slash replies. A toggle
   with two callers: **the function does the work and says it in the prompt; the slash
   handler adds the chat line** — else every click announces twice.
4. Resolve the theme **per call, per colour name** (`_G.BiSTheme` at call time), never at
   file load — addons sorting before `BiSTheme` alphabetically capture nil and run on the
   inline fallback forever, invisibly.
5. Harness asserts (below). Mutation-test each one before believing it.

## Testing a console without a screen (four traps, all paid for)

- **Step the clock in 0.05 s slices, never whole seconds.** One 3 s jump expires a `Say`
  before it is ever drawn; the test reads "event never showed" when the console is fine.
- **Assert the fade as ≥3 frames strictly between 0 and 1.** "Lowest alpha was 0" also passes
  a hard cut. Set `fade = 0.0001` and the test must go red.
- **Mock FontString** needs `GetParent`, `SetAlpha`, `SetFont` that records the size, and
  `GetStringWidth` that strips colour escapes and scales by that size — or the budget assert
  measures `|cffb980ff` and lies.
- **Load Console.lua the TOC way**, not the fallback branch. With BiSTheme absent the file
  installs its own palette into `_G.BiSTheme`, so "no theme installed" must gate on how the
  run was launched, not on whether the global exists. Run the whole suite a second time with
  a wrong-on-purpose accent (`dev/theme.lua`, `#ff0000`) — only a wrong palette proves the real
  one is read.
- Plus: **count frames parented to the header** (one button, one frame; move the number in the
  same commit as the button) and **a slot that reads a moving value must read an accessor**,
  not a copy taken at load (BiSHealing's shield slot pinned to whoever was shielded at login).

## The order quirk — fixed in minor 3 (11 Sep 2026, debt #4)

Was: `Con:Set(key, nil)` cleared the slot but left the key in `order`; the next
`Set(key, value)` saw `slots[key] == nil` and appended the key **again**, so a slot that
toggles (Nebbinator's `N new`, Tools' `asking`) ended up in `order` five or six times and
hogged the rotation. Now `Set` checks `order` for the key before appending — a key keeps its
place for good; `Current` already skips cleared keys. Test: toggle a slot five times,
`#order` stays 2 and the rotation alternates (the old code reads `TTTT`). Synced to every
embedder with `sync.ps1`; the section below says which.

## The cursor shift — fixed in minor 4 (11 Sep 2026, debt #18)

Was: the cursor was a `"_"`/`" "` swapped into the words FontString every half second, and
on the client that swap moved the words a hair each blink (Arn, on the Healing plate:
"every time it adds the _ it does a micro shift of the text"). Now the cursor is a
FontString of its own, hung off the words' right edge, blinked by **alpha**; the words text
never carries it and never changes between phases. `Text()` still reads `…_` / `… ` so
every existing assert holds. Test: paint two phases, `words:GetText()` identical and free of
`_`, `cur:GetAlpha()` alternating 1/0. Synced to every embedder the same day.

## Who wears it (verified on disk 11 Sep 2026)

BiSTools (first, 8 Sep) · Nebbinator 3.1.0 · BiSHealing rc49 · BiSGamba 1.1.0 · BiSJC v4 ·
BiSInnervate 3.3.6 — all six at md5 `9af6af04` (minor 2) until 11 Sep pm; minor 3 `9e7767eb`, then **minor 4 `07f3cb04`**, both synced the same day.

## Source — `BiSTheme/Console.lua` as on disk

```lua
--[[
  BiSTheme / Console.lua  --  the "BiS> _" prompt every BiS window carries in its header.

  Arn, 8 Sep 2026: "prompt `BiS> _` blinking should be in the header and cycle
  relevant messages: addon name, summoners at the stone, receiving summon,
  requesting summon, etc." Chat stays clean: what the addon is doing is said
  here, not in the chat frame. Chat is for /slash answers only.

  The title FontString of the window IS the console. It shows

      BiS> <text>_            cursor blinking at 2 Hz

  The words fade out and the next ones fade in (Arn: "fade in and out animations,
  not hard cuts"); the `BiS> ` prompt itself never moves. The console makes one
  extra FontString for the words, anchored to the right of the title.

  where <text> is either a standing SLOT (the addon's name, "2 at stone",
  "requesting...") - the slots rotate every `cycle` seconds - or a transient
  line pushed with Say ("Druid asks", "Druid accepted"), which jumps the queue,
  holds for `hold` seconds, then the rotation resumes.

  Usage from any addon:

      local con = BiSTheme.Console(titleFontString, { width = 110, size = 8 })
      con:Set("name", "Summon")                 -- slot 1: always the addon's name
      con:Set("stone", "2 at stone", "good")    -- a state slot; nil text clears it
      con:Say("Druid asks", "gold")             -- an event line, shown once
      con:Paint()                               -- from a ~0.2 s ticker: blink, rotate, expire

  Slots rotate in the order they were first Set. Pick words that fit the box:
  T.Fit trims with an ellipsis as the net, not the plan.

  Self-guarded like LibBiSComm: an addon may ship a copy under Libs\BiSTheme\ so
  the prompt works without BiSTheme installed. Newest CONSOLE_MINOR wins; the
  canonical file lives in the BiSTheme addon and is copied out, never edited in
  place. If BiSTheme itself is absent the palette falls back inline.
